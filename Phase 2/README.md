**IMPORTANT NOTE: AS OF May 30, 2025, THIS REPOSITORY IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT AND REVIEW. PLEASE, CONTACT THE DEVELOPERS BEFORE USING ANY OF THE CODE OR RESULTS**

## 1. Objective
This repository serves to fulfill the commitments of the grant by compiling the deliverables developed during the project.

The tasks were:


The expected outputs of the project were:

*	An open-source repository with a summary of the methods, the code and the data to produce the source-specific drought indicators for all hydrologic regions. This might be in draft form for review and posterior incorporation of feedback.
 framework to develop multi-sectoral drought hazard indicators.
*	An innovative methodology for linking drought hazard indicators and impacts.
*	Open access data and methods for drought hazard indicators and impacts.
*	Exploratory mapping tools, including sector-specific drought hazard indicator maps and drought risk profiles.
*	An engagement process that could be useful for ongoing tracking of drought impacts.

This repository contains the methods, code and data related to all the outputs except for the engagement process, which is included as a separated document.
## 2. Contents
There are three folders in this directory, including:

* **[Documents](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/tree/main/Documents)**: includes the description of three methodologies developed during the project (including sources of data, code, and results) and the slides of the final workshop:
  * [Methodology 1. User-oriented drought indicators in California](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/blob/main/Documents/01_User-oriented%20drought%20indicators.pdf)
  * [Methodology 2. System drought indicator for users with complex supply portfolios](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/blob/main/Documents/02_System%20drought%20indicator%20for%20users%20with%20complex%20portfolios.pdf)
  * [Methodology 3. Linking drought indicators with impacts in highly-managed water systems](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/blob/main/Documents/03_Linking%20drought%20indicators%20with%20impacts%20in%20managed%20systems.pdf)
  * [Final workshop slides](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/blob/main/Documents/230508_NIDIS_Final%20Workshop.pdf)
* **[Functions](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/tree/main/Functions)**: includes all the code developed during the project. It is explained and linked properly in the description of the three methodologies
* **[Data](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/tree/main/Data)**: Includes the input data, the data downloaded to develop the indicators, the processed data (or intermediate results), and the results and visuals. As some of this data is too large, we include links to dropbox files, but following the methods and code described, anyone should be able to reproduce all results.
