"Other  Recovery wells are installed when contamination is present in groundwater. Groundwater is the source of about 37% of water that flows through counties and cities to supply households and businesses. It can easily be contaminated by man-made products such as: gasoline, oil road salts and chemicals. All factors produce unfit and unsafe groundwater for human use. Recovery wells stop this transaction from occurring. When a recovery well (extraction well) is installed, it extracts these pollutants on a long term or short basis. The well can vary in size from 1” to 8”, which all depends on the site conditions, groundwater depth and drilling method used. Once pollutants are free from the ground and tested, the recovery process proceeds. Contamination is treated and disposed.",1,other,
