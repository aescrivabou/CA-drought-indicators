**Lead Principal Investigator:** Alvar Escriva-Bou, aescriva@ucdavis.edu, University of California, Davis

**Current and Past Collaborators:** Ellen Hanak (PPIC); Jeff Mount (PPIC); Michael Dettinger (Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego); Ted Grantham (UC Berkeley); Josué Medellín-Azuara (UC Merced); Kurt Schwabe (UC Riverside); John Abatzoglou (UC Merced); Greg Pierce (UCLA); Andrew Ayres (UN Reno); Armen Konialian (UCLA); Annabelle Rosser (PPIC); and Spencer Cole (PPIC)

**Supported with funding from:** The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) under different grants (see the phases for explicit acknowledge of the grants).

## 1. Objective
This repository contains documents, code and visuals related to different projects with the common goal of developing drought early warning systems in complex water systems, using California as a case study.

## 2. Contents
The different folders in this repository include the outcomes of the different projects:

Phase 1: 

re are three folders in this directory, including:

* **[Documents](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/tree/main/Documents)**: includes the description of three methodologies developed during the project (including sources of data, code, and results) and the slides of the final workshop:
  * [Methodology 1. User-oriented drought indicators in California](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/blob/main/Documents/01_User-oriented%20drought%20indicators.pdf)
  * [Methodology 2. System drought indicator for users with complex supply portfolios](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/blob/main/Documents/02_System%20drought%20indicator%20for%20users%20with%20complex%20portfolios.pdf)
  * [Methodology 3. Linking drought indicators with impacts in highly-managed water systems](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/blob/main/Documents/03_Linking%20drought%20indicators%20with%20impacts%20in%20managed%20systems.pdf)
  * [Final workshop slides](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/blob/main/Documents/230508_NIDIS_Final%20Workshop.pdf)
* **[Functions](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/tree/main/Functions)**: includes all the code developed during the project. It is explained and linked properly in the description of the three methodologies
* **[Data](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/tree/main/Data)**: Includes the input data, the data downloaded to develop the indicators, the processed data (or intermediate results), and the results and visuals. As some of this data is too large, we include links to dropbox files, but following the methods and code described, anyone should be able to reproduce all results.
