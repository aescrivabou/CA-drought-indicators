## 1. Objective
This repository serves to fulfill the commitments of the grant by compiling the deliverables developed during the project.

The expected outputs of the project were:

*	A framework to develop multi-sectoral drought hazard indicators.
*	An innovative methodology for linking drought hazard indicators and impacts.
*	Open access data and methods for drought hazard indicators and impacts.
*	Exploratory mapping tools, including sector-specific drought hazard indicator maps and drought risk profiles.
*	An engagement process that could be useful for ongoing tracking of drought impacts.

This repository contains the methods, code and data related to all the outputs except for the engagement process, which is included as a separated document.
