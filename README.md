## 1. Objective
This repository contains documents, code and visuals related to different projects with the common goal of developing drought early warning systems in complex water systems, using California as a case study.

## 2. Contents
The different folders in this repository include the outcomes of the different projects:

Phase 1 (2020 - 2023): [Linking Indicators of Drought Hazard to Multi-Sectoral Impacts: An Application to California](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/tree/main/Phase%201) 

Phase 2 (2023 - 2025): [Refining multi-sectoral drought hazard indicators oriented to assess drought impacts](https://github.com/aescrivabou/CA-drought-indicators/tree/main/Phase%202)
